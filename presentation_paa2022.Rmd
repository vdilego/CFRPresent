We illustrate the effect CFR scenarios that result from a different combination of $\beta_{a}$ and $Z_{t,a}$ values.

- Focus on the 84+, that has the highest risk of dying and was the first vaccinated. 

- Use Austria as case study for which we have detailed data on deaths, infections, vaccination status and testing by age; Consistent and unique testing policy.

- vaccine effectiveness in reducing deaths for ages above 84 is set at 0.85<sup>3</sup>

# Discussion

- CFR decline may **not** imply that vaccines are being effective in reducing deaths
--

- A constant CFR can **still** mean that vaccines are effective in reducing deaths
--

- Detecting infections among both the vaccinated and unvaccinated population is key
--

## Take-away: unless vaccinated people are **also** tested, it is hard to use the CFR as an indicator for monitoring the pandemic
